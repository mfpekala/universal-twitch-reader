# Universal OCR

NOTE: Previous work on this project, which produced segmented OCR target for twitch streams, has been moved into the Universal Twitch Reader (`UTR`) folder.

Current work revolves around capturing all text and making it indexable at the speed of type, more tuned for video-editing use cases than stream editing. This work lives in the `search` folder. Given that this functionality is significantly different from the twitch use case, and that the twitch code was written over the course of roughly 36 hours, I thought having a new folder for a fresh start would be helpful as major changes were necessary, and investment into existing code was relatively low.
